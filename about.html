                <p>Baking sweet treats has been a lifelong passion. As a young girl, my parents purchased for me an Easy Bake Oven. Almost immediately, an obsession was born! From cakes to cookies, cupcakes to pies, I wanted to make it all! While other interests have come and gone, fifteen years later, baking is still my main passion in life. I take great joy in baking for family and friends, and was often encouraged to begin my own business. After getting my business degree at UNO, I finally decided to go for it! I started my internet-based gourmet sweet treats business in October 2015. I am now the full time baker/owner for Be Sweet Bakery. In addition to my work life, I am married to my wonderful husband, Jacob, and a mother to a loving little boy, Jett.</p>
